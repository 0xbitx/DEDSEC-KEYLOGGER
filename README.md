<h4 align="center"> DEDSEC ADVANCED KEYLOGGER </h4>
<h4 align="center"> DAK is a Linux-based persistent keylogger tool designed for discreetly capturing linux & windows machine keystrokes.</h4>


### DESCRIPTION

DAK is a Linux-based tool designed for discreetly capturing keystrokes, providing users with a stealthy payload capable of hiding within a victim's system. It boasts persistence capabilities, ensuring continuous operation. Captured keystrokes are encrypted for security and seamlessly transmitted to a designated Discord webhook. This tool guarantees data confidentiality and integrity, making it ideal for covert surveillance and monitoring purposes.

### Features:
   * Stealth Payload: Operates discreetly within the victim's system, minimizing detection.
    
   * Persistent Payload: Maintains continuous operation across system reboots or shutdowns.
    
   * Keylogger Injection: Integrates the keylogger into legitimate applications, making it part of the target executable to capture keystrokes while maintaining the application's normal functionality.
    
   * Discord Webhook Integration: Utilizes Discord webhooks to send captured data, enabling remote monitoring.
    
   * Keystroke Conversion: Converts captured keystrokes into a human-readable format, resembling what the user sees on the screen, enhancing readability and comprehension of captured data.

### INSTALLATION
    * git clone https://github.com/0xbitx/DEDSEC_KEYLOGGER.git
